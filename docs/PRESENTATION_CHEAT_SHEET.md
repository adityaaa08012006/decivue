## ⏱️ Timeline (15 minutes)

| Time      | Who      | What                                      |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0-2 min   | Member 1 | Opening + Problem Statement               |
| 2-6 min   | Member 2 | Decision Intelligence (health, time jump) |
| 6-9 min   | Member 3 | Conflicts (LIVE DEMO - create conflict!)  |
| 9-12 min  | Member 4 | Advanced (governance, version control)    |
| 12-14 min | Member 1 | Technical Highlights                      |

## 🔥 Must-Show Features (Top 5)

1. **Time Jump** → Health signals change, invalidated stays frozen
2. **Live Conflict Creation** → Create 2 opposing assumptions, detect = WOW!
3. **Governance Lock** → Can't edit locked decision = enterprise-ready
4. **Version History** → Who changed what = accountability
5. **Deprecation Lessons** → Failed decisions = organizational learning

---

## 📊 Numbers to Drop

- **24 database tables** (complexity)
- **20 business decisions** (realistic scale)
- **5 assumption conflicts** (auto-detected)
- **220 days of historical data** (not toy example)
- **29 migrations** (evolving system)
- **95%+ confidence scores** (precision)

---

## 💬 Key Talking Points by Feature

### Decision Intelligence

- "Health signal is calculated from assumptions, constraints, dependencies, AND time"
- "Lifecycle changes automatically trigger notifications"
- "Time jump simulates future to predict which decisions will fail"

### Conflict Detection

- "Structured parameters enable machine understanding"
- "Dropdown-level conflicts: Revenue increase vs decrease = automatic detection"
- "Confidence scores prevent false positives"

### Governance

- "High-impact decisions require second reviewer"
- "Locked decisions can't be changed = audit trail"
- "Complete version history = compliance-ready"

## ❓ Judge Questions - Quick Answers

**"How does this differ from Jira?"**
→ "Jira tracks tasks. We track strategic decisions and their rationale. Git for decisions."

**"How does conflict detection work?"**
→ "Structured parameters + confidence scoring. Same category + opposite values = conflict."

**"What about scalability?"**
→ "Multi-tenant architecture, RLS at database level, tested with 220 days of data."

**"Any AI/ML?"**
→ "Deterministic conflict detection (not ML - too critical). AI for report summaries only."

**"Hardest challenge?"**
→ "Balancing flexible input with precise conflict detection. Solved with multi-level templates."

## 🎬 Handoff Phrases

**1 → 2**: "Let me hand it to [Name] to show the intelligence engine in action."

**2 → 3**: "But decisions don't exist in isolation. [Name] will show conflict resolution."

**3 → 4**: "Beyond conflicts, enterprises need governance. [Name] will cover that."

**4 → 1**: "[Name] will wrap up with our technical architecture."

## 🚨 Emergency Fixes

| Problem                | Fix                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Backend crashed        | `npm run dev` in backend folder    |
| No data showing        | `npm run seed-plot-armor` (30 sec) |
| Conflicts not detected | Click "Detect Conflicts" button    |
| Time jump hangs        | Skip it, come back later           |

## 🎯 Opening Lines (Member 1)

> "Imagine running a coffee shop chain with 20 major decisions in flight - expansions, marketing campaigns, equipment upgrades. Some conflict. Assumptions are outdated. Constraints violated. How do you manage this complexity? That's Decivue."

---

## 🏁 Closing Lines (Member 2)

> "Decivue transforms decision-making from reactive firefighting to proactive management. It catches conflicts before they cause problems, preserves organizational learning from failures, and makes teams smarter over time. Thank you - happy to answer questions!"

## 🌟 Energy Tips

- **Smile!** Show enthusiasm
- **Make eye contact** with judges
- **Speak clearly** (not too fast)
- **Point at screen** when explaining
- **Nod along** when teammates speak
- **Stay standing** (posture = confidence)

---

## 🎪 The "Wow" Moment Flow

1. Show stable decision (health: 91)
2. Click "Time Jump +30 days"
3. Watch health drop to 75
4. Point out notification generated
5. Show invalidated decision DIDN'T change
6. Say: **"This is how we predict which decisions will fail."**
