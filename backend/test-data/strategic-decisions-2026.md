## Decision 1: Cloud Infrastructure Migration to AWS

**Status:** APPROVED

### Decision Summary

We have **decided to migrate** our entire on-premise infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (AWS) by June 30, 2026. This strategic decision will transition all production workloads, databases, and applications to AWS cloud platform.

### Rationale

The current on-premise infrastructure is reaching end-of-life, and maintaining physical hardware is becoming cost-prohibitive. Cloud migration will provide improved scalability, better disaster recovery capabilities, and reduce our operational overhead by approximately 30%.

### Implementation Timeline

- Phase 1 (March 2026): Assessment and planning
- Phase 2 (April-May 2026): Migration of non-critical systems
- Phase 3 (June 2026): Production workload migration
- Go-live date: June 30, 2026

### Key Assumptions

- AWS pricing remains stable or decreases over the contract period
- Our engineering team can acquire necessary cloud certifications within 8 weeks
- Current on-premise contracts can be terminated without early termination penalties
- Data transfer costs will not exceed $75,000 for the entire migration
- Network bandwidth is sufficient for cloud connectivity

## Decision 2: Marketing Budget Increase for Product Launch

**Status:** APPROVED

### Decision Summary

The executive team has **approved an increase** of $250,000 to the Q2 marketing budget, bringing the total Q2 marketing spend to $625,000. This budget increase is specifically allocated for the upcoming product launch campaign.

### Rationale

Market research indicates strong demand for our new product line, and competitor analysis shows this is a critical time window for market entry. The additional investment will fund digital advertising, influencer partnerships, and a multi-city launch event series.

### Expected Outcomes

- Target: 40% increase in brand awareness
- Goal: 5,000 qualified leads in first 60 days
- Projected ROI: 3.5x within 12 months
- Market share increase: 8-12% in target segment

### Key Assumptions

## Decision 3: Remote-First Work Policy Implementation

**Status:** APPROVED

### Decision Summary

Effective March 1, 2026, we are **implementing a permanent remote-first work policy** across all departments. Employees will have full flexibility to work from home, with optional office access for collaboration and meetings.

### Rationale

Employee surveys indicate 87% preference for remote or hybrid work arrangements. This policy will improve work-life balance, reduce our real estate footprint by 60%, and enable talent acquisition from broader geographic regions. Annual savings are projected at $1.2M from reduced office space.

### Implementation Details

- Home office stipend: $1,500 per employee (one-time)
- Monthly internet/utilities allowance: $100 per employee
- Office space downsizing: Retain 2 collaboration hubs (NYC and SF)
- Equipment refresh: All employees receive new laptop and ergonomic setup

### Key Assumptions

- Team productivity will remain at 95% or above current baseline levels
- Collaboration tools (Zoom, Slack, Miro, Notion) are sufficient for all remote work needs
- Current office lease for main headquarters can be terminated with only 3-month penalty
- Employee satisfaction scores will increase by at least 20%
- Voluntary turnover will decrease by 15% due to improved work-life balance

## Decision 4: TypeScript Adoption for All New Development

**Status:** APPROVED

### Decision Summary

Going forward, the engineering department has **decided that all new software projects** will be developed using TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript. This decision applies to frontend, backend, and tooling code.

### Rationale

TypeScript provides static typing that catches errors at compile-time rather than runtime, reducing production bugs by an estimated 40%. The type system improves IDE support, code documentation, and developer onboarding. Industry trend analysis shows 78% of new JavaScript projects now use TypeScript.

### Technical Impact

- All React components will use TypeScript (.tsx files)
- Node.js backend services will use TypeScript
- Build pipeline updated with TypeScript compiler
- Existing JavaScript projects will be gradually migrated over 18 months

### Key Assumptions

- 100% of development team commits to learning TypeScript within 6 weeks
- Migration time for critical existing JavaScript codebases is manageable (estimated 200 hours)
- TypeScript tooling integrates seamlessly with our current CI/CD pipeline
- Increased type-checking time does not significantly impact developer productivity (max 10% overhead)
- Community support for TypeScript libraries remains strong
